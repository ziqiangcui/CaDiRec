# Context Matters: Enhancing Sequential Recommendation with Context-aware Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning

This is the code for our paper "Context Matters: Enhancing Sequential Recommendation with Context-aware Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning."
The code is implemented based on DDPM (https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch.git) and Huggingface (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
- PyTorch 2.0.0+cu118
- Huggingface

Please install huggingface before running the code.
First, git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
Then move it to the root directory of our code, rename as "huggingface".

## Running the Experiments
To run the experiments, use the following command:
python main.py
